# Looplens Brain

Looplens is a privacy-focused social media platform that prioritizes security. It was initially planned in December 2023 and development started in January 2024. The platform utilizes Python for the backend, PostgreSQL as the database, Prisma for database control, and is deployed using Docker.

## Development

If you have changed your Docker settings, you may need to re-edit the .env files.

### Brain

Navigate to the API directory, install Python dependencies, update database schemas using Prisma, apply changes to the database, regenerate Python code generated by Prisma.

```bash
cd ./brain
pip install -r requirements.txt
prisma migrate dev
prisma db push
prisma generate
```

and after run server at [:8000](http://localhost:8000)

```bash
cd ./brain
uvicorn main:app --reload
```
